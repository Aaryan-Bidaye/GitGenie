# Release Documentation

## Overview

**Complete removal of the `gitgenie` subdirectory from the repository.** This change eliminates the entire Python-based AI-powered git commit CLI tool, including all source code, configuration files, build artifacts, and tests. This appears to be a cleanup or restructuring effort, possibly moving the project to a different location or deprecating this implementation.

## Key Changes by File

### Removed Files

- **`gitgenie/README.md`**  
  Removed setup instructions for `.env` file configuration with OpenRouter API credentials.

- **`gitgenie/pyproject.toml`**  
  Removed Poetry project configuration defining the `gitgenie` package (v0.1.0) with the `gcg` CLI entrypoint.

- **`gitgenie/poetry.lock`**  
  Removed dependency lock file containing pinned versions of Click, Typer, Rich, Pygments, and other dependencies.

- **`gitgenie/dist/` artifacts**  
  Removed built distribution files (`.whl` and `.tar.gz`) for version 0.1.0.

- **`gitgenie/src/gitgenie/main.py`**  
  Removed main CLI implementation with three commands:
  - `test` - Preview AI-generated commit messages
  - `commit` - Auto-commit with AI-generated messages
  - `doc` - Placeholder command

- **`gitgenie/src/gitgenie/__init__.py`**  
  Removed package initialization file.

- **`gitgenie/__pycache__/` files**  
  Removed Python bytecode cache files.

- **`gitgenie/tests/__init__.py`**  
  Removed test package initialization.

## Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Complete removal of the `gitgenie` tool**

- The `gcg` CLI command will no longer be available after this change
- Any existing installations via `pip install gitgenie` will continue to work but won't receive updates
- Users relying on this tool must migrate to an alternative solution
- All OpenRouter API integration for AI-powered commit messages is removed

## Migration / Upgrade Notes

### For Current Users

1. **Uninstall the package** if previously installed:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall gitgenie
   ```

2. **Backup any custom configurations** (`.env` files with API keys) before updating

3. **Consider alternatives**:
   - Manual commit message writing
   - Other AI commit message tools (e.g., `aicommits`, `commitgpt`)
   - Custom scripts using OpenRouter or other LLM APIs

### For Repository Maintainers

- Verify no other parts of the codebase depend on `gitgenie/`
- Update any CI/CD pipelines that built or tested this package
- Remove any documentation references to the `gcg` command
- Archive or migrate the code if needed for future reference

## Usage Examples

**N/A** - This release removes functionality rather than adding it.

Previously available commands (now removed):
```bash
# These will no longer work:
gcg test              # Preview AI commit message
gcg commit            # Auto-commit with AI message
gcg commit --add-all  # Stage all and commit
```

## Next Steps / Follow-ups

- [ ] Update root-level README if it references `gitgenie`
- [ ] Remove `gitgenie` from any monorepo documentation or guides
- [ ] Archive PyPI package or mark as deprecated if published
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG with deprecation notice
- [ ] Consider adding a migration guide if users exist
- [ ] Verify no broken links in documentation pointing to removed files
- [ ] Clean up any GitHub Actions workflows that reference this subdirectory
